## How to Run the Project

You can run this project in two ways:

### 1. Open Directly in Browser

- Double-click `index.html` or right-click and choose "Open With" your preferred browser.

### 2. Run with a Local HTTP Server (Recommended for Assets)

If you want to avoid CORS issues or see images/icons load correctly, use Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## How to Reuse Components

- **Navigation Bar**: Copy the `<nav>` block and related CSS for any project needing a responsive navbar.
- **Button Styles**: Use the `.btn` class for consistent, modern buttons.
- **Hero Section**: Adapt the `.header`, `.content`, and `.image` blocks for any landing page hero.
- **Info Cards**: The `.image__content` blocks can be reused for feature highlights or stats in other projects.

To use in another project, copy the relevant HTML and CSS, update the content, and ensure the assets and icon CDN links are included.
